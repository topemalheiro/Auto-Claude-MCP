"""
Spec Creation Module
====================

Modular spec creation pipeline with complexity-based phase selection.

Main Components:
- complexity: Task complexity assessment (AI and heuristic)
- requirements: Interactive and automated requirements gathering
- discovery: Project structure analysis
- context: Relevant file discovery
- writer: Spec document and plan creation
- validator: Validation helpers
- phases: Individual phase implementations
- pipeline: Main orchestration logic

Usage:
    from spec import SpecOrchestrator

    orchestrator = SpecOrchestrator(
        project_dir=Path.cwd(),
        task_description="Add user authentication",
    )

    success = await orchestrator.run()

Note:
    SpecOrchestrator and get_specs_dir are lazy-imported to avoid circular
    dependencies between spec.pipeline and core.client.

    Module-level placeholders (with _ prefix) are defined for CodeQL static
    analysis. The actual exported names (without _ prefix) trigger __getattr__
    for lazy loading.
